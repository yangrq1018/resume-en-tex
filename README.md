## English/Chinese Resume Latex Project

This repository contains the tex documents for my resume, in both English and
Chinese language. The PDF files compiled from source tex documents are also
tracked. You may freely download the source file for modification, as template
for your own resume, or whatever you like, as long as you adhere to the LICENSE
provided.

If you are hiring managers and would like to contact me, you are also welcomed
to download the PDFs for the contact information.

I kindly ask everyone not to abuse the contact information in the resume for spam
purpose.

## How to Compile
If you are interested and would like to use the project as a template, here is
how to compile:

`latexmk -xelatex resume-en.tex`

`latexmk -pdf resume-cn.tex`
